## Provide a more in-depth analysis of the Citi Bike Trip data to see if it could be a good fit to roll out in Des Moines.

### We will look at the length of bike checkouts, the number of trips depending on the hour of the day, and the number of bike trips per day of the week. All these will be broken down by gender as well.

## Results

- To start off the project we look at a simple chart based on user type. We have the Customer and the Subscriber as the two categories here.  We see that we mostly cater to the subscriber the most. These are people who plan on this being their transportation into and around town on almost a daily basis.

- We can look at the start times to see when most people use the bike, between the 7:00AM and 7:00PM. This creates a pattern to the usage and lets us set up times for repairs and to make sure that the number of bikes needed are available to use in upper usage times.

- Now we must look at the duration that the bikes are used. 
We can see by this chart most bikes are returned in less than one hour.

- You can see that most of you target audience will be the male gender.

- This is showing that on a normal work week that the bike program will be used at begging of work and the end of work. This will help keep a steady flow of clients.

- As we can see here the support for the biggest market group will be the males. With the second coming in close is the female. This can be used to help boost female customers by making campaigns to show off what this company can offer them.

- The Weekdays are the more used times for all genders. You can tell that the weekends are dominated by the male, but you still have female and unknown partaking on the program. We can see that in the customer the unknown has higher usage.

## Summary

-   We can see this program can be a success. The first steps in gaining the customer and subscriber interest is to run two campaign. The first will be the male due to this will probably be the highest user. The second for the female with campaigns that will appeal to the gender. We can see that most of the bikes will need to be in service on the weekdays and this will be more for going to and from work to bus stops, out to lunch, or even a location near the home the customer lives. You can see we do have some time set aside to work on the bikes that will not disrupt the availability of the bikes needed in those times. We have a good foundation on if the system could be implemented in the desire area. We can see treads that could go for any area. On bit of data, I would have liked to have is the population density in the area in question and the jobs nearby. Would have like to see how bike friendly the road would be for the area covered by the program.
